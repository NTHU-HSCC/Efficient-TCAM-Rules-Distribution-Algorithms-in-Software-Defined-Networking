Readme file of PBD and PBD-Generalize (2018/03/13)

1. Click the file "PBD" to open the project

2. there are three files in this project: "main.cpp", "NODE.CPP" and "NODE.H"

   "main.cpp" is the main body of this simulation program.

   "NODE.H" defines several functions and constants used in "main.cpp"

   "NODE.CPP" implements the functions defined in "NODE.H"

3.  In the file "NODE.H", 

		the constant "GENERALIZE" is used to change the testing mode of "main.cpp".

			if the value of "GENERALIZE" is equal to 0, the file "main.cpp" will do the simulations for PBD.

			if the value of "GENERALIZE" is equal to 1, the file "main.cpp" will do the simulations for PBD-Generalize.

		the constant "MAXLINE" is the maximum length of each rule read from the file.

		the constant "BITNUM" is the maximum legnth of each entry of rule table.


	In the file "main.cpp", 

		the array "filename" is the name of testing rules, there are serveral rules generated by ClassBench in the folder "New".

		Change "filename" to the target rule you want to test.

		line 38 : "outfile.open("XXX.txt");" is used to set the output filename, you can change XXX to any other name you want. 

4. Build and compile "main.cpp" to start the simulations.
