Readme file of SSP (2018/03/13)

1. Click the file "SSP" to open the project

2. there are three files in this project: "main.cpp", "Node.cpp" and "Node.h"

   "main.cpp" is the main body of this simulation program.

   "Node.h" defines several functions and constants used in "main.cpp"

   "Node.cpp" implements the functions defined in "Node.h"

3.  In the file "Node.h", 

		the constant "MAXLINE" is the maximum length of each rule read from the file.

		the constant "BITNUM" is the maximum legnth of each entry of rule table.

		the constant "ALPHA" is used to balance the overhead of partitioned tables and the distribution of rules. 

		the constant "END_THRESHOLD" is used to decide when SSP should be terminated.

	In the file "main.cpp", 

		the array "filename" is the name of testing rules, there are serveral rules generated by ClassBench in the folder "New".

		Change "filename" to the target rule you want to test.

		line 29 : "outfile.open("XXX.txt");" is used to set the output filename, you can change XXX to any other name you want. 

4. Build and compile "main.cpp" to start the simulations.
